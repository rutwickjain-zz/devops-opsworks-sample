### Introduction:

This is a sample project which demonstrates the use of AWS Cloudformation
on how to work with AWS OpsWorks and VPC in context of a sample workflow.

The cloudformation uses a template which creates a VPC  and an OpsWorks stack
and a layer with specific configurations, within that VPC. The template 
also create an EC2 instance in the configured OpsWorks layer which will 
execute a sample use case based on the configuration and recipes defined
for that layer. This specific configuration includes installing "etcd"
- a distributed key value store that provides a reliable way to store data
across a cluster of machines and "confd" -  a service to manage local
application configuration files using templates and data from etcd, consul
or other such services.

The sample use case is basically launching an instance EC2 instance in OpsWorks,
configuring etcd on it, downloading a sample ".pem" file from AWS S3 and storing
it as key-value pair in etcd, and eventually invoking confd to create a file named
"foo" under /tmp with content as the value of the stored key. At the end of this
workflow, one can login to the EC2 instance and locate file /tmp/foo which will 
display the content of the .pem file.

More information about "etcd" and "confd" can be found out using below links.

#####  Set-up Requirements:

AWS IAM User/Role with full permission to VPC, CloudFormation, OpsWorks, EC2 and S3.

VPC - For our requirement, we are just going to create one public subnet. We do 
not necessarily require any private subnet for this particular use case and hence
we won't be requiring any NAT instance to be created in public subnet as well.

To create the entire infrastructure stack, we will use an already defined AWS Cloud
Formation template hosted on Github. To invoke AWS CloudFormation using this template,
we can use either of the below two options:
1) AWS CloudFormation console 
2) AWS command-line (AWS CLI)

If you are using AWS CLI, make sure it is installed and configured with appropriate IAM credentials
on your machine. You can install aws-cli from apt or yum repositories depending on your OS. Amazon 
Linux has, by default, has already installed on it. Windows user can download the MSI installer.
 
 
### Important Notes 

1) Chef client 11.10 is used here. 
2) Make sure that IAM User has appropriate permissions to AWS CloudFormation,
OpsWorks, EC2, IAM, S3 and CloudWatch. The IAM user requires these permissions to
successfully execute the creation of different resources in the templates.
3) Be sure to select the appropriate region where you want to create the stack. Also, the SSH Key
provided as a parameter to the template should present in that region.
4) MySSHKey parameter is mandatory.
5) Make sure you pass appropriate region as a parameter while invoking create-stack. Default region
will be selected if not provided.

### Parameters for CloudFormation template

AWS EC2 key-pair : Required
EC2Instance Type : Default - t2.micro
Service Role for OpsWorks : Default - aws-opsworks-service-role
Instance Profile - : Default - aws-opsoworks-ec2-role
Assign Elastic IP to EC2 instance: Default - false


AWS EC2 key-pair is mandatory parameters while the rest are optional. Default value
will be chosen for parameters in case not provided.

AWS CLI(Optional)

#####  Execution/Run 

Commands to create, update and delete stack

eg : To just provide EC2 instance type as a parameter and leave the other parameters
as default, run below command.

aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name test --template-body file:///home/ubuntu/workspace/vpc-opsworks-cf.template --parameters ParameterKey=MySSHKey,ParameterValue=workstation --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --region=us-west-2

aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources --stack-name test --region=us-west-2
aws cloudformation list-stack-resources --stack-name test --region=us-west-2
aws cloudformation  delete-stack --stack-name test --region=us-west-2
